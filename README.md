# Introduction

 The study examines how Sub-Saharan Africans perceive their health and healthcare systems, revealing that the region has the lowest global ratings for well-being and satisfaction with health services.
Despite heavy donor investment, especially in HIV/AIDS programs, many
 residents report poor health and dissatisfaction with care quality. The research aims to understand regional variations and the factors influencing these perceptions, including age, education, income, religion and HIV prevalence.
